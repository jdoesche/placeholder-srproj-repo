            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>Starting for the 2024-2025 school year, Tennessee mandated new K-12 Computer Science (CS)
                standards across all grade levels. Although there is a publicly available guidebook for
                these standards, the layout appears overwhelming, complex, and difficult for parents to 
                interpret. Not only are an estimated 60% of adults in Tennessee reading at or below an 8th 
                grade level, but most parents’ own education has little to no experience with CS. This 
                inexperience can cause anxiety, lack of confidence, and gendered assumptions about technology 
                which can directly affect parent involvement. Research suggests that not only is parent 
                involvement critical for positive outcomes for a child’s education, but that there should be 
                more STEM resources/support for parents by using technology.</p>
